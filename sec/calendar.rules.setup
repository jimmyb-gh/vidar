#  NOTE FOR ALL RULES:
#  THE ONLY THING SEC SHOULD WRITE TO STDOUT IS AN IP ADDRESS.
#  WRITE TO FILES FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.
#

# Contexts set by calendar rules.
#
# BUSINESS_HOURS - a context for business hours (7:00am to 11:59pm, M-F)
# OFF_HOURS - a context for all other hours.
#
# Two calendars are needed since calendar is run every minute
# and we don't actually know when SEC will be started (or restarted)
# 
# *  *  *  *  *  *

# |  |  |  |  |  |
# |  |  |  |  |  +--- matches years (0-99) denoting the last two digits (optional)
# |  |  |  |  +------ matches weekdays (0-7, 0 and 7 denoting Sunday)
# |  |  |  +--------- matches month (1-12)
# |  |  +------------ matches days (0-31, 0 denotes last day of any month)
# |  +--------------- matches hours (0-23)
# +------------------ matches minutes (0-59)
#
# The day and weekday conditions are joined with AND not OR logic
# so "0 1 25-31 10 7" means 1AM on last Sunday in October.
# See the Sec man page for other subtle differences.

# This calendar rule is an actvity check.
# Every minute a process list is run and saved to file /tmp/ps.txt
# Only the requested items are saved (cpu, start, ruser, uid, command).
# Then two lists of network processes are done, one for ipv4
# and one for ipv6.
